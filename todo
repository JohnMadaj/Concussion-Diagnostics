TODO SPRING BREAK:
Start/Stop phases need to be developed into separate modes:
    1) Setup mode: Used prior to actual device start.
        - Device Manager needs to display available devices to connect to as per receiver
        - Receiver will communicate participant info TO PD upon device connection. This has to be done
            prior to Tracking mode, in tracking mode the receiver will not talk to PD at all.
    2 Tracking mode: This is the "game time" mode where measurements are actually computed and displayed.
        - In this mode, PD talks to receiver, not other way around
        - Devices cant be assigned in this mode, and participant info cant be changed with few exceptions.
        - Both receiver and PD will need to know what mode they are in. (maybe PD doesnt need to know?)

Diagnostic Algorithm (on PD) needs to be improved with presentable research at ASPIRE.

Compliance/QoL features:
- Device status/battery life needs to display on user software
- Side menu buttons need to update alongside changes to participant list (additions/removals)
- Assign a dictionary to organizer that links participant id to participant objects (for fast access),
    meanwhile the participant LIST will still be maintained to display participants in order.
    OR, JUST keep the dictionary organizer and force side menu to display in alphabetical order
    (there might be reasons not to do this, look into the code).
- Participant panel needs to be reorganized and given more display data (reference the mockup here)
